# HelloWorld
This is the first repository I have tried on Github. 20161210
This lined was written down when I tried to learn how to make a new brach that differs from the master branch. Now I think I understand it. A branch other than the master branch is a copy version that is not ready to be the "master" branch, i.e. it can still be edited.
